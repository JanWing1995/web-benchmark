# web-benchmark

Evaluates Sentry & Replay impact on website performance by running a web app in Chromium via Playwright and collecting various metrics.

The general idea is to run a web app without Sentry, and then run the same app again with Sentry and another one with Sentry+Replay included.
For the three scenarios, we collect some metrics (CPU, memory, vitals) and later compare them and post as a comment in a PR.
Changes in the metrics, compared to previous runs from the main branch, should be evaluated on case-by-case basis when preparing and reviewing the PR.


## Getting Started
